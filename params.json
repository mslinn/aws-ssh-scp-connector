  "body": "AWS SSH/SCP Connector\r\n=====================\r\nThis is a small utility to help you connect to your aws instances.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\nSome examples\r\n```bash\r\neu1ssh 012345678\r\neu1ssh i-012345678\r\neu1ssh ubuntu@012345678\r\neu1ssh ubuntu@i-012345678\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\neu1scp 012345678:/tmp/some-file.zip /local/file/path.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssumptions/Requirements\r\n------------------------\r\nIt is assumed that you have installed and properly configured AWS ec2-tools. Any version that supports `ec2-describe-instances` will do fine\r\n\r\nHow does it work\r\n----------------\r\nDepending on the name of the script/symlink the script determines region and command to execute. After that it picks up the first command line parameter and parses it for username/path/host information.\r\nA propper instance-id is constructed. After that the instances (filtered by that propper instance-id) are listed and the private address is collected.\r\nAn ssh config file is built and the command executed.\r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n-------------\r\nAs is this will *NOT* work for you. You *NEED* to make edits to make it work for you.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the script there are several variables. Change them to taste as follows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# the bastion base name host\r\n_bastion_base='bastion'\r\n_bastion_end='company.com'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full bastion hostname is constructed with the scheme `${_bastion_base}.${_full_region}a.${_bastion_end}`\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndeclare -A _region_map=(\r\n\t[eu1]=eu-west-1\r\n\t[us1]=us-west-1\r\n\t[ap1]=ap-southeast-1\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeclare mapping between short region name (3 letters) and full region name. The full name is used in several places so it must be a valid region name.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n_personal_user='username'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour username on the bastion host.\r\n\r\nSetting it up for multiple regions\r\n----------------------------------\r\nIn order to not duplicate the script the suggested installation is as follows:\r\n\r\n* Clone repo\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/zeridon/aws-ssh-scp-connector.git ~/toos/aws-ssh-connector\r\n```\r\n* Symlink to the propper names in your local/global bin directory\r\n```bash\r\nln -s ~/toos/aws-ssh-connector/aws-ssh-connector ~/bin/eu1ssh\r\nln -s ~/toos/aws-ssh-connector/aws-ssh-connector ~/bin/eu1scp\r\nln -s ~/toos/aws-ssh-connector/aws-ssh-connector ~/bin/us1ssh\r\nln -s ~/toos/aws-ssh-connector/aws-ssh-connector ~/bin/us1scp\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give you ssh/scp to the eu1 region\r\n\r\nOther notes\r\n-----------\r\n* Reading the source is your best friend.\r\n* I am using this for quite some time and it works for me. It might not for you though\r\n* Bastion host is assumed to be in the a zone\r\n* SCP support is more or less experimental. For single files it will work, but multiple (or speciffying additional options the way you are used to ... no)\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nThis is released under MIT license.
